            Reader, you are the Lessor. Understandably, the Lessor identifier is
            also an Investor in the NFTBooks system, but instead of just owning
            the NFTBooks token, Lessor uses the token more intelligently by
            buying a book and getting long-term value from the rental. Sounds
            quite similar to staking in other projects but you have an immediate
            profit, when you don't want to rent it anymore, you can transfer the
            book to someone else. So, Lessor is a Level 2 Investor.

            It can be seen that Lessor's cash flow used in the system is the
            most of all NFTBooks objects, Lessor is the backbone of the whole
            NFTBooks. Without Lessor, NFTBooks is no different from a normal
            NFTs, and just like a book platform like Google Play or Kindle, the
            only difference is that Author can fully benefit, but the reader
            cannot read books at the cheapest price. This is contrary to the
            criteria set forth by NFTBooks, both for the benefit of Authors and
            Readers.

        Lessor owns and lends the book. Do you think Lessor is similar to a
        library? Exactly, each Lessor is a personal library. When many
        individual libraries appear in a market, it means they are competing for
        the same customer market. Lessors will have to choose between keeping
        the price the same and forfeiting the loan to another Lessor or
        accepting a discount in order to complete that day's rental.

        This event will result in the price of a private library getting back
        similar to a Public Library, although it is not free, its fee will be at

        early-stage NFTBooks developers.

        This competition will help grow our NFTBOOKS platform by value depth;
        While Author must be serious about competing on content quality, Lessor

            If Lessor owns 10,000 different books, will it take time to manually

            Answer:
            <br />
            Similar to Authors, we also build index analysis tools for Lessor to
            be able to compete fairly and react quickly to the market. In
            addition, our bookshelf adjustment is both manual and automatic,
            which automatically depends on the current rental value to be in the
            best interest of Lessor, this is similar to Liquidity's Pool of.

            If Authors released the same book for the second time, third time
            etc?<br />
            Answer:<br />
            This could be a commitment between Author and Lessor, since Author
            already receives a passive income from the books sold, there is no
            reason for them to publish a book again. If the Author does so, it
            will lead to people who become Lessor for profit to lose trust and
            their prestige points and priority to buy books when they are on
            sale will be greatly reduced. So, we call this implicit commitment.

          Public Library is free, but Public Library funding comes from local or
          national budgets. This is the tax of everyone in the area that is
          deducted from the government budget. Because it's free, there will
          always be a need for maintenance money to flow into the Public
          Library, which is bad for the government budget.

          Charitable funds can also do business to make a profit and then give
          charity, so why can't Public Library make a profit? Or is it too
          cumbersome to be profitable? As for Lessor, they buy a book with their
          own money, and they get the NFTBooks token back; The value of the
          NFTBooks token will increase as its scarcity appears by its holders,
          as well as the increase in the number of Readers that will make the
          need to buy NFTBooks token for use increase every day and every hour.

          And Lessor can transfer books to others if there is no need to rent
          them anymore. Because Books in NFTBooks are not only valuable in terms

          paper books also for the purpose of archiving and honouring its value.

        To buy the electronic copyright of a book, the Public Library will have
        to pay a lot of money to the publisher for only one reader at a time,
        and for physical books, the Public Library has to borrow all of a book.
        is also entirely possible. With NFTBooks, we value sharing, instead of
        you just buying and reading it once, share them so more people can read
        them at a cheaper price. This is exactly why Lessor was born. Lessor
        owns all of Author's single-book supply, so the supply of books will be
        abundant enough to solve the problem of book scarcity. Although there
        will be a part of users who buy books to read and store and not just for
        investment purposes, we believe that the majority of book owners will
        accept the story of becoming a Lessor, as it has no harm to them, but
        will bring value to both them and the Author. We believe that NFTBooks
        has a lot of potential to help the Lessors who keep the flow of NFTBooks
        profitable beyond what we've just skimmed above.
